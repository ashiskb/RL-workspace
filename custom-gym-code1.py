#The Game
#Weâ€™re going to build a maze game that has 2 simple rules:
#The agent can move 1 step at a time in 4 directions: Up, Down, Left, and Right.
#The game is over when the agent reaches the goal.

#Custom class `ImageMazeEnv` must extend `gym.Env` class

# Then, you need to override 2 attributes and 4 methods which function as follow:
# Attributes:
#- action_space: All available actions the agent can perform.
#- observation_space: Structure of the observation.
#
#Methods:
#- step: Perform an action to the environment then return the state of the env, the reward of the action, and whether the episode is finished.
#- reset: Reset the state of the environment then return the initial state.
#- render(optional): Render the environment for visualization.
#- close(optional): Perform cleanup.
#Note that all the code related to this must be in an envs folder inside your project directory.

#Action & Observation space
#The action space is straightforward. There are 4 available actions: Left, Right, Up, and Down. We can define it using Discrete class provided for discrete space.
